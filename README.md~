### Feedback on Technical Tests

There are certainly easier ways to pull information from the file system and attach it to routes than the route you seemed to take with Hapi (for example, there were a lot of files). In the logic itself, you could have just tried to read the path from the file system and handle the error if the file is missing, but you did a lot of processing to make sure you were requesting a valid file. I'm not saying there was anything wrong, it just could have been a little more elegant. (Discussing use of HAPI plugin architecture).

The project contains files / dependencies that are not used by the application, code is not tidy, unused variables, commented out blocks.
